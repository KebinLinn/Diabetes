# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project is designed to predict diabetes using machine learning models and data visualization techniques. The project consists of five main components:

Machine Learning Models: The project uses two machine learning models - Linear Regression and Random Forest for predictions.  
Data Visualization: The project includes code that generates a heatmap to visualize the dataset and understand the relationship between the features.  
Web Interface: An HTML file is used to control the layout and appearance of the website and structure the web page.  
Website: A file named â€œWebsite.py" which runs the website locally using flask and incorporates the model through a h5 file   
h5 File: A h5 created when running either model; used so that the website can interact with the model

## **Required Packages**
The following packages are required to run the models and the website:
Flask
Numpy
TensorFlow
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn (sklearn)
Pandas
Seaborn

pip install flask numpy tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn pandas seaborn
